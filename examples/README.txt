Most example scripts provided here must be run from this directory, since they
need the "data" subdirectory with the example data files and/or the "bases"
subdirectory for saving/loading the basis sets. If you wish to copy or run such
scripts elsewhere, please make sure that these paths are available or modify
them accordingly.
