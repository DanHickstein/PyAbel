Two Point  (Dasch)
==================


Introduction
------------

The "Dasch two-point" deconvolution algorithm is one of several described in
the Dasch paper [1]_. See also the :doc:`“three-point” <three_point>` and
:doc:`“onion peeling” <onion_peeling>` descriptions.

How it works
------------

The Abel integral is broken into intervals between the :math:`r_j`
points, and :math:`P^\prime(r)` is assumed constant between :math:`r_j` and
:math:`r_{j+1}`.

When to use it
--------------

This method is simple and computationally very efficient. The method
incorporates no smoothing.


How to use it
-------------

To complete the inverse transform of a full image with the ``two_point method``, simply use the :class:`abel.Transform` class: ::

    abel.Transform(myImage, method='two_point').transform

If you would like to access the ``two_point`` algorithm directly (to transform a right-side half-image), you can use :func:`abel.dasch.two_point_transform`.


Example
-------

.. plot:: ../examples/example_dasch_methods.py
    :include-source:
